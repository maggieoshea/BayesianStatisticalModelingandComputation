This folder contains the code associated with the final project for Bayesian Statistical Modeling & Computation. 

Notes for use: 
1. The file downloadairqualitydata.R has to be run first, before running the file MCMC_examplebayes_windtempregression.ipynb because it downloads the data used in the python script. 
2. The other two scripts operate separately and there is no order that they need to be run in. 
3. Please reach out to the author for the data for the GHCN map making script which could not be uploaded due to size.
