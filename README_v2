This folder contains the code to reproduce the figures for Problem Set 5 which is a Final Project pitch. 
The figures include a station-date density map for GHCN stations, a barplot of average GHCN station by income group, and a plot of MAE based on station density. 
The link to download the data for the barplot is included in the script, however the GHCN map and MAE plot data is large and thus is available upon request!
